# Universal Obsidian Knowledge Vault

> **Purpose**  
> Accumulate, connect, and expand knowledge across **all life domains**—from professional expertise (programming, machine learning, etc.) to work know‑how, personal insights, and hobbies—using a Zettelkasten‑style approach.  
> Every contributor (myself, AI agents, teammates) must follow these guidelines to ensure consistency, readability, and scalability.

## 1️⃣ Core Project Goals

1. **Atomization**
   - Break concepts, ideas, and experiences into _bite‑sized_ notes
   - Focus each note on a **single topic**, including definition, background, context, examples, and takeaways
2. **Organic Linking**
   - Use `[[backlinks]]`, Graph View, and tags (`#Domain/Subtopic`)
   - Expose relationships between notes to strengthen the “thinking network”
3. **Accessible Explanations**
   - No jargon compression ❌ → Prefer friendly language, real‑world examples, and metaphors
   - Enable step‑by‑step learning for people with varying knowledge levels
4. **Storytelling & Context**
   - Provide origin stories, history, and fun facts to make reading enjoyable

## 2️⃣ Writing Principles

| Item                | Rule                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Style**           | End every sentence in a **noun form**.<br>e.g. “What is time complexity?” → “Time Complexity”<br>“Performance has improved.” → “Performance Improvement Potential”             |
| **Note Types**      | • **Concept** `[[Supervised Learning]]`<br>• **Comparison** `[[Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning]]`<br>• **Application** `[[Supervised Learning/License Plate Recognition]]` |
| **Learning Stages** | Beginner → Core → Practice → Advanced → Research Directions                                                                                                                    |
| **Metadata**        | Recommend an `---` YAML block<br>`created`, `updated`, `author`, `tags`, `stage`, `type`, etc.                                                                                 |
| **Tag Rules**       | `#MainCategory/SubCategory` (e.g. `#Programming/Python`, `#Life/Travel`, `#Work/ProjectManagement`)                                                                            |
| **Exceptions**      | For code snippets or equations, use fenced code blocks; keep explanations in plain text                                                                                        |

## 3️⃣ Technical Specifications

- **Platform**: Obsidian (Markdown‑based)
- **Essential Features**:
  - `[[Backlinks]]`, Graph View, Tags, Dataview (optional)
- **Version Control/Sharing**: GitHub, GitLab, or personal cloud storage

## 4️⃣ Expected Outcomes

- A domain‑agnostic **knowledge graph** that grows naturally
- Progressive learning paths from beginner to advanced
- Rich context ensures both **reading enjoyment and practical utility**

## 5️⃣ Roadmap

1. **Create Core Notes** – Seed notes for major life categories
2. **Optimize Interlinking** – Systematically connect core ↔ derived notes
3. **Map Learning Stages** – Design “learning journeys” via Dataview or folder structure
4. **Visualize** – Check clusters and hub nodes in Graph View
5. **Share** – Optionally publish via GitHub Pages, blog, Notion, etc.

## 6️⃣ Contribution & Maintenance Guide

- When adding a new note, include a link to **this guideline** at the top
- If formatting discrepancies are found, leave **review comments** or submit a PR for fixes
- Minimize metadata and tag inconsistencies—maintain uniformity
- AI‑generated notes must undergo **fact‑checking and tone review** before merging
