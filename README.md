## 🚀 Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Installation & Launch

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-project-dashboard.git
cd ai-project-dashboard

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run dashboard (web version)

# Or run as desktop app
npm run electron-dev
```

### Step 2: First AI Conversation

**For Cursor users:**
- Simply open this project in Cursor
- Rules in the `.cursor/` folder are automatically applied
- Try saying "Create a new project PRD" in Cursor's Chat

**For other AI tool users:**
- Copy markdown files from the `prompt/` folder to your AI
- Example: Copy `prompt/prd.md` content to ChatGPT and start conversation

### Step 3: Check Task List
- When AI generates or updates the `docs/tasks.json` file
- You can view task lists and progress in real-time on the dashboard

## 💡 Problems This Tool Solves

**Limitations of existing AI development:**
- 🔄 Context loss when conversation sessions change
- 📊 Difficulty tracking overall project progress
- 💸 Additional costs for separate task management tools

**This tool's solution:**
- ✅ Consistent task management through AI rules
- 📈 Real-time progress visualization with dashboard
- 💰 Maximize use of AI tools you already subscribe to

## 🔄 Workflow

```
1. Idea → 2. AI Conversation → 3. tasks.json Generation → 4. Dashboard Management
```

### 1️⃣ Idea Stage
When you have new project or feature ideas

### 2️⃣ AI Conversation Stage
**Role of .cursor/ rules:**
- When you open this project in Cursor, markdown files in `.cursor/rules/` folder are automatically sent to AI
- Each file defines how AI should help in specific situations:
  - `prd.md`: Convert ideas into concrete product documents
  - `task-breakdown.md`: Break down PRD into developable task lists
  - `task-updater.md`: Reflect task progress in JSON

**Conversation examples:**
```
User: "I have a new chat app idea. Create a PRD for it"
AI: [prd.md rules applied] "What users are you targeting? What are the core features..."

User: "Create a development plan based on this PRD"  
AI: [task-breakdown.md rules applied] Generate tasks.json file

User: "Task 1.2 is completed"
AI: [task-updater.md rules applied] Update tasks.json
```

### 3️⃣ tasks.json Generation
AI generates/updates the `docs/tasks.json` file:
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "title": "User Authentication System",
      "status": "pending",
      "priority": "high",
      "subtasks": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4️⃣ Dashboard Management
- 📊 **Real-time Statistics**: Total/completed/in-progress task counts
- 🔍 **Smart Filtering**: Filter by status, priority
- 📱 **Responsive Table**: Intuitive task list display
- 🔄 **Auto Sync**: Check JSON file every 5 seconds

## 🎯 Usage Tips

### Effective AI Conversation

3. **Regular updates**: Notify AI whenever tasks are completed
